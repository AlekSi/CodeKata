http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_one_s.html

There is no code, just my answers.

> does fractional money exist?
Yes, although they are not very common in case of shops.

> when (if ever) does rounding take place?
At the very end, when printing price tag.

> how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
Do I need? I don't, but it may be a requirement. :)

> are costs and prices the same class of thing?
No idea what does this mean.

> if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using "buy two, get one free", how do you value the stock?
See Ruby/Strategy/free.rb.

Is it a good example for Strategy design pattern?
